        <h2 class="inv-date">Feb. 2020 - Present</h2>
        <p class="para-body">
            During my Freshman year of college, I got involved with BBoys Anonymous, which was the only
            breakdance/freestyle-dance team in UCI. I also became Board Member during the same year.
            In my Junior year of college, I became one of the three coordinators of the team. During my
            time there, I helped plan events such as ALL IDC, which was a community event for all dance
            teams in UCI with over 300 attendees. I also helped fundraise for the club by selling food
            at vendor fairs. But the main role I have is being the graphics designer, where some of my works
            can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJtVWC5LGLb4TZ_23eSkjwRu2VSGc6Pm?usp=sharing">here</a>.

        <p class="para-body">
            I expanded my professional knowledge and soft-skills by spending 20 hours for 
            4 weeks on livestreams and virtual activities. This program gave me a great overview
            of what goes on in a company such as AT&T.

            During my first quarter at U.C.I., I joined this club for experience and collaborated on creating a game 
            called "Aspect Alchemy" with 5 other people. My role was game designer. The game can be found

            This was the first hackathon I have been to. This was a beginner-oriented hackathon and I collaborated 
            with 3 other people to create "Swype" which was meant to be a U.C.I. platform for students to sell "Swipes" 
            (passes to eat at the U.C.I. cafeterias) to other students. The project can be found

        <h2 class="inv-date">Oct. 2019 - Nov. 2019</h2>
        <p class="para-body">
            Joining this dance team and consistenly doing its practices pushed my endurance and time-mangement skills. 
            During the last two weeks before the actual performance for the KASA Freshmen Dance-off, we had consistent 
            practices on weekdays from 7:30 p.m. to hours after midnight, sometimes to even seeing the sun rise up.
