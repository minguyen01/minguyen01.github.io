            <p><b>Web Development Intern</b> | Jun. 2022 - Jul. 2022.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This Web Development internship focused on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The internship emphasized 
                a lot on us learning new things so there were workshops every workday. We worked on different types of 
                website projects, with some projects emphasizing more on certain topics that we learned for that week
                such as creating Mondrian Art through grids and responsive websites through flexboxes.

                I tutored for the UCI's ICS 45J class: "Programming in Java as a Second Language."
                I hosted Zoom meetings for two hours two times a week to assist any students that needed help with the 
                course in any way, whether it be through debugging or going over any concepts.

                I expanded my professional knowledge and soft-skills by spending 20 hours for 4 weeks on livestreams 
                and virtual activities. This program gave me a great overview of what goes on in a company such as AT&T.

                B-Boys Anonymous is the only freestyle dance club at UCI. For my roles, I became a Board Member during my 1st 
                year, a coordinator during my 3rd year, and the president during my 4th year. Being a part of Board means I 
                got to plan events such as ALL IDC, which was a community showcase event for all dance teams in UCI that 
                reached over 300 attendees. I also participated in fundraisers involving selling food at vendor fairs and 
                did some graphics design work as well for promotions.

                Level V Origins is a hip-hop dance team at UCI. I was a general member and performed in many showcases/exhibitions 
                such as All IDC, Spring Quarter Dance Festival, and VSA's Vietnamese Culture Night. We had practices for two days 
                every week for four hours each.

                In my first quarter at UCI, I joined this club to experience something new. During my time here, I 
                collaborated with 5 other people on developing a game called "Aspect Alchemy." My role was game designer,
                where I came up with concepts and ideas along with playtesting the game.

            <p>
                ZotHacks was a beginner-oriented hackathon and also the first one I have been to. I collaborated 
                with 3 other people to create "Swyper" which was meant to be a U.C.I. platform for students to sell "Swipes" 
                (passes to eat at the U.C.I. cafeterias) to other students. We were given two days to work on the project
                together. While we did not place, our project was the 2nd most voted by the other contestants.

                UCI KASA had a hip-hop dance team every year to perform in an annual event known as KASA Freshmen Dance-off.
                Joining this dance team and consistently attending practices during my first year of college
                pushed my endurance and time-mangement skills. During the last two weeks before the actual performance
                for the KASA Freshmen Dance-off, we had practices all weekdays from 7:30 p.m. to sunrise.
