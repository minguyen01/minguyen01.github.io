        <p class="para-body">
            I was bored during the Summer of 2020 due to COVID-19, so I decided to learn HTML on my own with all this free-time.

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <h2>Self-taught</h2>
        <p class="para-body">
            I decided to learn CSS for the same reason in learning HTML. I am solid on it, but there is still a lot I have to learn and
            experiment with.

        <h1>Graphics Designing</h1>
        <h2>Self-taught</h2>
        <p class="para-body">
            I started learning about graphics designing in middle school. Although not a career focus, this is a skill 
            that I have been periodically using throughout my life and so I am comfortable with it. Softwares I have 
            experience in includes Paint.NET, Affinity, GIMP, and Photoshop. (I used Photoshop the least because 
            subscription-based services are too expensive)

        <h1>Video Editing</h1>
        <h2>Self-taught</h2>
        <p class="para-body">
            I started learning how to edit videos because a lot of my classes made me do video assignments. What came out
            of this were skills in video editing through softwares such as Sony Vegas and Windows Movie Maker.
