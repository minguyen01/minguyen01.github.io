        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="para-body">
            My name is <b>Minh Nguyen</b> and I grew up in San Francisco, California. I am currently a
            <b>third-year Computer Science major</b> at the <b>University of California, Irvine</b> who aspires to be
            a <b>software engineer</b> that not only creates reliable and robust programs, but also clear and clean UI design.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p class="para-body">
            I grew up in <b>San Francisco, California</b> for a large part of my life. I lived in the <b>Tenderloin</b> neighborhood but due
            to it being a relatively high-crime area, it was not the most pleasant part of the city to live in. However, I
            found myself to work closely with the community there through the non-profit organizations in the area.
            My <b>experiences from college</b> includes planning/managing events with up to 300+ attendees, working in a team where
            important decisions with tradeoffs must be made, and designing engaging posters for the clubs I was involved in.

        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p class="para-body">
            While <b>computer science</b> remains the main area of study throughout my education, I am also interested in
            <b>graphics designing</b>. I took a lot of graphics design courses in both middle-school and high-school,
            and it is something that I also enjoyed doing a lot. I was able to improve and put this skill to use by
            creating posters, flyers, and t-shirts for the various clubs that I was involved in.
            One of my hobbies that I am most committed to is <b>break-dancing</b>, which I started during high-school
            and later became one of the coordinators for the break-dancing team in UCI during my third year
            in college. I also like bingeing punk rock albums, with some of my favorite bands being Thrice, Silverstein,
            and Rise Against.
