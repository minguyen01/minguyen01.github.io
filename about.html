        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
        <p class="para-body">
            I am currently a student in the class of 2023 at the University of California, Irvine. I am majoring in Computer Science 
            and is working towards attaining a Bachelor of Computer Science. I grew up in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco 
            for almost the entirety of my life. While it might not be the most pleasant part of the city to live in, I found myself to 
            work closely with the community during high-school.

        <h1>What I Value</h1>
        <p class="para-body">
            As a college student with many more steps to get up in life, a value that I hold closest to me is <strong>hard work</strong>.
            It is not my style to cut corners. If I am going to do something, then I will give it my best shot because I believe
            that this is one of the greatest ways a person can expand their current knowledge ceiling.

        <h1>What I Do</h1>
        <p class="para-body">
            Besides computer-science related things, one of my main hobbies is break-dancing, although I am open to hip-hop dancing 
            as well. I started break-dancing during my last year of high-school and it is one of the few hobbies that I feel committed to 
            and plan on continue on doing. I also like bingeing punk rock albums.
